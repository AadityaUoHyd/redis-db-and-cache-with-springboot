# redis-db-and-cache-with-springboot

- Redis means REmote DIctionary Server, which is an open-source key-value pair based NoSQL database.

  Its written in 'ANCI C' and its an in-memory database, thus performance wise very fast as not required trip to disk.
  
  It provides low latency and high throughput, and can be used in cache management, database and as message broker.
  
  It also have some flexible data structures : Lists, Sets, Sorted sets, Hashes, String, HyperlogLogs, Bitmaps, Geospatial.

- Will try to explore few API stuff for Redis database and cache along with spring-boot. 

  Must read internal README files for more details of each demo projects.
